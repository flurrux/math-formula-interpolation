- find a good way to specify origin points, maybe when writing out nodes:
{ type: "bin", value: "+", origin: [0.5, 0.5] } //place the origin at the middle of the node

- only non-group nodes are actually interpolated: char, text, rule, contours, rule

transition cases:
- move, scale, change color
- branch node into several
- merge several node into one
- fade in / fade out
- cancelling two nodes
- morph node into another

- specfiy node correspondence
    - explicitly write them out as object: { from: node1, to: node2 }
    - specify the path: { from: [["items", 2], "numerator", ["items", 1]], to: ... }
    - specify an id in the formula, 
    for interpolation functions write then: { id: [some-id], interpolate: [some-function] }
    if a node branches into mutliple, the ids are not unique anymore. in that case use a 
    second id, branchId, that takes precedence over the first id.
